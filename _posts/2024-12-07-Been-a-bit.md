I released 3.0.16 a couple of days ago. I haven't reported any of our progress since over a year ago. There's been a
few minor fixes. Google finally landed their replacement API for clickable text, which allowed me to fix a
long-standing issue with allowing both selecting, copying, and clicking text. I migrated the installer to Conveyor.
They provide us with an automated updater, and they released an API for managing updates. Windows and Mac should be
prompted now before updating. I realized that Linux builds weren't properly being scaled. Jetbrains provides an
improved Java runtime that fixed that issue. I replaced most of our icons with public domain SVG's and managed to
scale the compass to actually be usable.
