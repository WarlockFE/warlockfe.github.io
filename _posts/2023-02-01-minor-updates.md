Warlock 3.0.5 is out now.

The last few releases have mostly been focused on polish. Without getting into details, Warlock is still a bit slower
than I would like, but I've improved things a bit in 3.0.2. This release improves the appearance a bit, but mostly
just updates to the latest version of Compose and migrates from Material Design 2 to 3.

Try it out, let me know what you think.
